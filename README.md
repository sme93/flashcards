## Description

The Array Prototype Method Flashcard set is the perfect application to help you study all of your array methods. This program can be run through the player's command line - the player will be able to see the questions, take guesses, and see the final score at the end of the round. Once the player has finished the initial round, their score will be shown and they will have the opportunity to go back and take another crack at the flashcards that were incorrect
the first time around.

## Installation

Clone down the flashcards-starter repository to your computer.

```bash
git clone [git@github.com:sme93/flashcards-starter.git]
```

Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```

To check to see if all the tests that were written for this program are passing, run `npm test` in your terminal. There should be 34 passing tests.

To run the program:

```bash
node index.js
```

## Walkthrough

Once the player has initialized the flashcards program in the terminal, they will be asked 30 questions and can enter their guesses by entering 1, 2, or 3. After they have received feedback for a correct or incorrect
answer, the player will have to hit enter to go to the next question. When the round is over, the player will be given the flashcards that they didn't get correct, and can try again.
